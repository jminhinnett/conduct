## Conduct on Era of Health
We created this repository as a place for [Users](terminology.md#users) to fork, contribute to, and provide feedback on our policies, procedures and agreements (collectively know as "[Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents)") that govern the use of [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health). While this is our official repository of open-sourced [Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents), it may not reflect the exact policies that are live on [Era of Health's](terminology.md#era-of-health) Website or app, because this site is updated separately.

### What can I do here?

#### First, you can use and adapt our policies! 

We are proud to offer this repository under [CC0-1.0](#license). That means that if it is useful to you, even in part, you're welcome to use it, without restriction. Of course, keep in mind that we wrote these as they apply to Era of Health, so you'll need to make sure the content applies to what you're using it for, and adapt it as appropriate. See the [license section](#license) for use guidelines.

Because we are providing these policies to our community, we believe it is only responsible to also provide the history and insight that a repository of commits, pull requests, and issues can offer. Over time, the repository's commits, pull requests, and issues will allow anyone wanting to use our policies to see the discussions and alterations that have gone into them.

#### Second, you can contribute to making our Conduct Documents even better.

We host collaborative development on Era of Health's [Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents) here. That means youâ€™re welcome to provide feedback via a pull request or by opening an issue. When opening an issue, please look over the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md). This will help us respond to your concern more quickly.

### That seems like great power! What about the great responsibility?

That's easy: just be responsible. Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and help us maintain a respectful environment for all contributors.

#### There are a few things you should _not_ post in this repository:

- Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support. We may not respond to issues promptly. If you need help, contact Support (help@eraofhealth.com) and they'll get you an answer.
-	Please avoid hypotheticals. We can't give you legal advice, which means we often can't tell you if a hypothetical situation would or wouldn't be a violation of our policies. We also can't tell you what you should or shouldn't do. We can tell you how we interpret our policies.
- Please don't give other users legal advice, to avoid confusion.

### How often will Era of Health review these policies?

We have a annual review and modification process for the policies in this repository. This allows plenty of time for discussion and lets our community rely on our policies. Of course, Era of Health may alter our policies outside that schedule if necessary, such as when we have new product releases.

#### What's the process? 

Policies will be open for discussion and feedback throughout the year. You can expect that someone from Era of Health's legal department will see your feedback, but we might not respond immediately. If you need an immediate answer on a legal matter, contact Suppor (help@eraofhealth.com).

Annually, we'll do thorough review of the feedback we have received. If changes are not needed, great! We'll let you know that we're not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. 

If changes to a policy _are_ needed, we will freeze feedback for two weeks. We'll draft changes based on the pull requests and input we've gotten. Then we'll post the updated policy as a pull request, and we'll get your feedback on the pull request. The updated policy will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

For those who are following this repository, the posting of the updated policy will provide a notice of any modifications to the policy. Please note, links will not resolve in the rendering of the policies in this repository.
