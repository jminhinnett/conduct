Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever [you](terminology.md#user) prefer. [We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) made an issue template to request information that will help [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) better understand [your](terminology.md#user) feedback.

Before [you](terminology.md#user) decide to open an issue, browse [open issues] to see current requests. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also generally want to hear about: 

* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of our policies

Open an issue to tell [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) about any of the above. [You](terminology.md#user)  may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) know when issues are completed and can be closed.

If [you](terminology.md#user) decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will merge it directly. It's not because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) don't like [your](terminology.md#user) ideas, but because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

If changes are not needed, great! [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) let [you](terminology.md#user) know that [We're](terminology.md#era-of-health) not putting out an update, and [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) may alter this document outside that schedule if necessary, such as when [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) have new product releases.

[You](terminology.md#user) can expect that someone from [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) will see [your](terminology.md#user) feedback, but [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) might not respond immediately.

If changes to the document are needed, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will freeze feedback for two weeks. [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) draft changes based on the pull requests and input [We'ev](terminology.md#era-of-health) gotten. Then [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) post the updated document as a pull request, and [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) get [your](terminology.md#user) feedback on the pull request. The updated document will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

### Value-Based Care
[Accountable care organizations (ACOs)](terminology.md#accountable-care-organizations-acos) were originally designed by the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](terminology.md#Centers-for-Medicare-&-Medicaid-Services-CMS) to provide high-quality medical care to Medicare patients. In an ACO, doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers work as a networked team to deliver the best possible coordinated care at the lowest possible cost. Each member of the team shares both risk and reward, with incentives to improve access to care, quality of care, and patient health outcomes while reducing costs. This approach differs from fee-for-service health care, in which individual providers are incentivized to order more tests and procedures and manage more patients in order to get paid more, regardless of patient outcomes.

 Like PCMHs, ACOs are patient-centered organizations in which the patient and providers are true partners in care decisions. Also like PCMHs, ACOs stress coordination and data sharing among team members to help achieve these goals among their entire patient population. Clinical and claims data are also shared with payers to demonstrate improvements in outcomes such as hospital readmissions, adverse events, patient engagement, and population health.
