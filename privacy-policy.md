You also have the option to give us more [information](terminology.md#information) if you want to, and this may include "Protected Health Information."

"Protected Health Information" is defined by Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 164.402 and is [information](terminology.md#information) that [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) receive from a [User](terminology.md#user)  or an [Organization](terminology.md#organization).

[Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) uses cookies to make interactions with [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) service easy and meaningful.[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide [information](terminology.md#information) for future development of [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health).

A cookie is a small piece of text that [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health); however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user.

## Google Analytics
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use Google Analytics as a third-party tracking service, but [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) don’t use it to track you individually or collect your Information.[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use Google Analytics to collect  [information](terminology.md#information) about how [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) website performs and how [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) users, in general, navigate through and use [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health).

[Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) will not, nor will [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [users](terminology.md#user) individually; collect any of your information other than IP address, or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further [information](terminology.md#information) about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.

Certain pages on [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site may set other third-party cookies. For example, [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) try to minimize these third party cookies, [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) can’t always control what cookies this third-party content sets.

## Tracking
"Do Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of [information](terminology.md#information) about your online activity from third-party tracking services.[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not permit third-party services to track your activity on [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site beyond [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of here. Because [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not share this kind of data with third-party services or permit this kind of third-party data collection on [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) for any of [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) users, and [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not track [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [users](terminology.md#user) on third-party websites ourselves, [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.

If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions.

Open an issue to tell us about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** 
Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps us know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will merge it directly. It's not because [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) don't like your ideas, but because [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

At this moment [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) have an annual review and modification process of the repository and the feedback [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) received. If changes are not needed, great! [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) let you know that[We're](terminology.md#era-of-health)  not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) may alter this Privacy Policy outside that schedule if necessary, such as when [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) have new product releases.

You can expect that someone from [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health)s legal department will see your feedback, but [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) might not respond immediately. If you need an immediate answer on a legal matter, contact support@eraofhealth.com

If changes to a policy are needed, [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will freeze feedback for two weeks. [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) draft changes based on the pull requests and input [we've](terminology.md#era-of-health) gotten. Then we'll post the updated policy as a pull request, and we'll get your feedback on the pull request. The updated policy will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

**NOTE:** 
Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If you need help, contact support@eraofhealth.com and they'll get you an answer.

Please avoid hypotheticals. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can't give you legal advice, which means [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) often can't tell you if a hypothetical situation would or wouldn't be a violation of [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also can't tell you what you should or shouldn't do. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can tell you how [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) interpret [our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies.
