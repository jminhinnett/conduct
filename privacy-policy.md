## What information Era of Health collects and why information from website browsers 
If you're just browsing the [Website](terminology.md#website) or mobile app, we collect the same basic information that most websites and apps collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an [account](terminology.md#account) or not.

The information we collect about all visitors to our [Website](terminology.md#website) and the mobile app includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

## Why do we collect this?
We collect this information to better understand how our [Website](terminology.md#website) visitors use Era of Health and to monitor and protect the security of the [Website](terminology.md#website) and mobile app. 

## Information from users with [accounts](terminology.md#account)
If you create an [account](terminology.md#account), we require some basic information at the time of [account](terminology.md#account) creation. You will create your own password, and we will ask you for a valid email address and phone number. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include "Protected Health Information."

"Protected Health Information" is defined by Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 164.402 and is information that we receive from a User or an Organization. It is information on a users past, present, or future physical or mental health condition, provision, or payment, and could be used to identify the user. 

A "User" (or “You,” and “Your”) is an individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using Era of Healths services; that accesses or uses any part of the [account](terminology.md#account), or that directs the use of the [account](terminology.md#account) in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for government [accounts](terminology.md#account).

An "Organization" is any individual or group that created an Organization [account](terminology.md#account) in Era of Health.

User "Personal Information" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as an email and password, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “Personal Information.”

User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our w[Website](terminology.md#website) and service.

We may use and/or disclose Protected Health Information in the same manner as Personal Information, as described above.  Additional uses or disclosures of Personal Health Information shall require the Patient’s authorization or a valid authorization on the Patient’s behalf.

For the remainder of this agreement “Information” will be defined as both User “Personal Information” and “Protected Health Information.”

## Why do we collect this?

We need your Information to create your [account](terminology.md#account), and to provide the services you request.

We use your Information, specifically your email, to identify you on Era of Health.

We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to.

We will use your email address and phone number to communicate with you if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. Please see our section on email, phone and text messaging communication for more information.

We limit our use of your Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. If we need to use your Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what Information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.

Era of Health employees does not access Information unless required to for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, with the consent of the Information owner.

If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an [account](terminology.md#account) on Era of Health. Era of Health does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will, unfortunately, have to close your [account](terminology.md#account). Please see our User Agreement for information about [account](terminology.md#account) termination.

## How we share the information we collect
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.

We do not disclose your Information outside Era of Health, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure.

We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Era of Health, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage across Era of Health. 

We will at times host advertising on Era of Health. We may occasionally embed content from third-party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. 

We may share Information with your permission, so we can perform the services you have requested.

We may share Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Policy. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under Privacy Shield, we remain responsible for it.

We may share Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your Information. The organization receiving any of your Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Policy or in our User Agreement.

## Payment Information 

When you purchase Services, your User Data, and credit card or debit card information is processed, stored, and kept secure by Stripe, a third-party credit card processing service. Your credit card information will be stored by Stripe in their restricted-access database. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We assume no responsibility or liability for damages resulting from Stripe’s processing, storage, or other use of your credit or debit card information or any User Data.

Stripe has been audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry. To accomplish this, Stripe makes use of best-in-class security tools and practices to maintain a high level of security.

## Our use of cookies and tracking  Cookies
Era of Health uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Era of Health.

A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting Era of Health; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies Era of Health sets are essential for the operation of the website or are used for performance or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you might not be able to log in or use Era of Health’s services.

## Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics as a third-party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use Era of Health. This helps us evaluate our users' use of Era of Health; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance.

Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of Era of Health. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your phone number.

Era of Health will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any of your Information other than IP address, or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.

Certain pages on our site may set other third-party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third-party content sets.

## Tracking
"Do Not Track" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third-party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of here. Because we do not share this kind of data with third-party services or permit this kind of third-party data collection on Era of Health for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting.

If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions.

Please see our section on email communication to learn about our use of pixel tags in marketing emails.

## How Era of Health secures your information
Era of Health takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect your Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of your Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Era of Health's global privacy practices
Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs.

We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to your Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard Contractual Clause agreements.

In particular:

* Era of Health provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection when we do collect your personal data.

* [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.

* [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting or deleting the data we have collected.

* [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing.  

* [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also provide our users with a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.

Era of Health operates as a data Processor and adheres to General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). In this limited role, Era of Health acts under the authority and instruction of Data Controllers who define the purpose and control the use of personal data. Data Controllers can:

In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and Era of Health regarding our handling of your Information, we will do our best to resolve it in a arbitration.

## How we respond to compelled disclosure
Era of Health may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.

In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, Era of Health strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.

## How you can access and control the information we collect
If you're already an Era of Health user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting Era of Health Support.

## Data Retention and Deletion
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may retain certain Information indefinitely unless you request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user [accounts](terminology.md#account), so unless you choose to request we delete your [account](terminology.md#account), we will retain your [account](terminology.md#account) information indefinitely.

If you would like to deactivate your [account](terminology.md#account) or delete your Information, you may do so in your user profile. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will retain and use your Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

## How we communicate with you
[We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will use your email address, phone or text messaging to communicate with you if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile.

Depending on your email, phone and text messaging settings, Era of Health may occasionally send notification emails, automated voicemails or text messages. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also send marketing emails, but only with your consent. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the emails we send you.

Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email. If you prefer not to receive pixel tags, please opt out of marketing emails.

## Q. Changes to this Privacy Policy

[We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) opened this Privacy Policy up for you to amend and contribute to. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) want you to see its historic revision and contribute to it future revision via a repository. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) take our relationship with you very serious and want to display nurture trust through transparency. By seeing the past revision you can see our progression of thought over time. By allowing you to post suggestions we are enlisting your help to make improvements to this Privacy Policy in conjunction with our ever-changing world. 

This Privacy Policy is open to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This means we give you permission to copy and re-use this Privacy Policy with our permission. No questions asked.  Note that CC0-1.0 does not grant any trademark permissions.

Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever you prefer. [We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) made an issue template to request information that will help us better understand your feedback.

Before you decide to open an issue, browse [open issues] to see current requests. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also generally want to hear about: 

* International issues with our policies
* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of our policies

Open an issue to tell us about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** 
Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps us know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that we will merge it directly. It's not because we don't like your ideas, but because we will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

At this moment we have an annual review and modification process of the repository and the feedback we received. If changes are not needed, great! [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) let you know that we're not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, Era of Health may alter this Privacy Policy outside that schedule if necessary, such as when we have new product releases.

You can expect that someone from Era of Healths legal department will see your feedback, but we might not respond immediately. If you need an immediate answer on a legal matter, contact support@eraofhealth.com

If changes to a policy are needed, we will freeze feedback for two weeks. [We'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) draft changes based on the pull requests and input we've gotten. Then we'll post the updated policy as a pull request, and we'll get your feedback on the pull request. The updated policy will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

**NOTE:** 
Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If you need help, contact support@eraofhealth.com and they'll get you an answer.

Please avoid hypotheticals. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can't give you legal advice, which means we often can't tell you if a hypothetical situation would or wouldn't be a violation of our policies. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also can't tell you what you should or shouldn't do. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can tell you how we interpret our policies.

Please don't give other users legal advice in this repository, to avoid confusion.
