## A. Definitions

**Short version**

*[We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) use these basic terms throughout the [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement), and they have specific meanings. [You](terminology.md#user) should know what [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) mean when [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*
* The “[Agreement](terminology.md#agreement)” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “User Agreement”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) Privacy Policy, available at www.eraofhealth.com), and procedures that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may publish from time to time on the [Website](terminology.md#website). Most of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) site policies are available at www.eraofhealth.com in the footer or on [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) publicly viewable github account https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/tree/master

* "[Bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth)" is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. [Bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth) may be characterized as network [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth), data [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth), or digital [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth). This definition is in contrast to other fields that define [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth) as an analog signal measured in hertz.

* "[Bots](terminology.md#bots)" also known as an internet bot, web robot, or WWW robot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Typically, [bots](terminology.md#bots) perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

* “[Content](terminology.md#content)” is [Content](terminology.md#content) featured or displayed through the [Website](terminology.md#website), including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the [Website](terminology.md#website) or otherwise available through the [Service](terminology.md#service). "[Content](terminology.md#content)" also includes [Service](terminology.md#service). [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content) is [Content](terminology.md#content), written or otherwise, created or uploaded by [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user). "[Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content)" is [Content](terminology.md#content) that [You](terminology.md#user), the [Users](terminology.md#user), create or own. See [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content).

* “[Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth)”, “We”, and “Us” refer to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth), Inc., as well as [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.

* "[Moral rights](terminoloyg.md#moral-rights)" are the rights of creators of copyrighted works. [Moral rights](terminology.md#moral-rights) are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if a creator has assigned their copyright rights to a third party, they maintain the [moral rights](terminology.md#moral-rights) to the work. They include the right of integrity and attribution unless waived. 

* "[Scraping](terminology.md#scraping)" also known as Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is the act of copying data from websites. While [scraping](terminology.md#scraping) can be done manually, the term typically refers to automated processes using a [bot or web crawler](terminology.md#bots).

* “[Service](terminology.md#service)” refers to the applications, software, products, and [Services](terminology.md#service) provided by [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth).

* “[User](terminology.md#user)”, also displayed as "You" or Your". In [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) legal documents, or while using [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) or working with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) API, this refers to the individual person, company, or [Organization](terminology.md#organization) that has visited or is using [Era of Health’s](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Services](terminology.md#service); that accesses or uses any part of the account, or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A [User](terminology.md#user) must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for government accounts.

* “[Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content)” is [Content](terminology.md#content), written or otherwise, created or uploaded by [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Users](terminology.md#user). "[Your](terminology.md#user) Content" is [Content](terminoloy.md#content) that [You](terminology.md#user) create or own.

* “[Website](terminology.md#website)” refers to [Era of Health’s](terminology.md#eraofhealth) website located at www.eraofhealth.com, and all [Content](terminology.md#content), [Services](terminology.md#service), and products provided by [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) at or through the [Website](terminology.md#website). It also refers to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth)-owned subdomains. This [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) also governs [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) product websites with [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) copyright in the footer. 

  Occasionally, websites owned by [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) may provide different or additional user agreements. If those conflict with this [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement), the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

 
## B. Account Terms  

**Short version** 

*A human must create [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account); [You](terminology.md#user) must be 13 or over; [You](terminology.md#user) must provide a valid email address, and [You](terminology.md#user) may not have more than one [User](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account). [You](terminology.md#user) can have multiple  [Organization](terminology.md#organization) [Accounts](terminology.md#account).  [You](terminology.md#user) alone are responsible for [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) and anything that happens while [You](terminology.md#user) are signed in to or using [Your](terminology.md#user) [User](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account). [You](terminology.md#user) are responsible for keeping [Your](terminology.md#user) [User](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) secure.*

### 1. Required Information
[You](terminology.md#user) must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as [Your](terminology.md#user) phone number, is optional, unless [You](terminology.md#user) are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) need more information about the legal entity) or if [You](terminology.md#user) opt for a paid [Account](terminology.md#account), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### 2. Account requirements
[We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) have a few simple rules for [Accounts](terminology.md#account) on [Era of Health’s](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Service](terminology.md#service).

* [You](terminology.md#user) must be a human to create an [Account](terminology.md#account). [Accounts](terminology.md#account) registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. 

* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free [User](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account).

* [You](terminology.md#user) must be age 13 or older. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) must comply with United States law and not target [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Service](terminology.md#service) to children under 13, and [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) do not permit any [Users](terminology.md#user) under 13 on [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Service](terminology.md#service). If [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) learn of any [User](terminology.md#user) under the age of 13, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will terminate that [User’s](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) immediately. If [You](terminology.md#user) are a resident of a country outside the United States, [Your](terminology.md#user) country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, [You](terminology.md#user) are responsible for complying with [Your](terminology.md#user) country’s laws.
[Your](terminology.md#user) login may only be used by one person — i.e. a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid [Organization](terminology.md#organization) [Account](terminology.md#account) may create separate logins for as many [Users](terminology.md#user) as its subscription allows.

* Overall, the number of [Users](terminology.md#user) must not exceed the number of [Account](terminology.md#account)s you've ordered from [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health).

### 3. User Account security
[You](terminology.md#user) are responsible for keeping [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) secure while [You](terminology.md#user) use [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Service](terminology.md#service). [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help [You](terminology.md#user) maintain [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account's](terminology.md#account) security, but the [Content](terminology.md#content) of [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) and its security are up to [You](terminology.md#user). 

[You](terminology.md#user) are responsible for all [Content](terminology.md#content) posted and activity that occurs under [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) even when [Content](terminology.md#content) is posted by others who have [Accounts](terminology.md#account) under [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account)).

[You](terminology.md#user) are responsible for maintaining the security of [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account) and password. [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from [Your](terminology.md#user) failure to comply with this security obligation.

[You](terminology.md#user) will promptly notify [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) if [You](terminology.md#user) become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Service](terminology.md#service) through [Your](terminology.md#user) [Account](terminology.md#account), including any unauthorized use of [Your](terminology.md#user) password or [Account](terminology.md#account).

### 4. Additional terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to [Your](terminology.md#user) use of [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth). For example, [You](terminology.md#user) may be a member of an [Organization](terminology.md#organization) on [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) with its own terms or license agreements; [You](terminology.md#user) may download an application that integrates with [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth), or [You](terminology.md#user) may use [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with [You](terminology.md#user). 

If [You](terminology.md#user) are a government [User](terminology.md#user) or otherwise accessing or using any [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Service](terminology.md#service) in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) User Agreement applies to you, and [You](terminology.md#user) agree to its provisions.

It does not refer to the collection of information through [Era of Health's](terminology.md#eraofhealth) API. [You](terminology.md#user) may scrape the website for the following reasons:

If [You](terminology.md#user) collect any [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Users](terminology.md#user) information from [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth), [You](terminology.md#user) agree that [You](terminology.md#user) will only use the information [You](terminology.md#user) gather for the purpose for which [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [User](terminology.md#user) has authorized it.

## D. Your Content

**Short version** 

*[You](terminology.md#user) own [Content](terminology.md#content) [You](terminology.md#user) create, but [You](terminology.md#user) allow [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) certain rights to it, so that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) can display and share the [Content](terminology.md#content) [You](terminology.md#user) post. [You](terminology.md#user) still have control over [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#content), and responsibility for it, and the rights [You](terminology.md#user) grant [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) are limited to those [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) need to provide the service. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) have the right to remove [Content](terminology.md#content) or close [Accounts](terminology.md#account) if [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) need to.*

### 1. Responsibility for Your Content
[You](terminology.md#user) may create or upload [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content) while using the [Service](terminology.md#service). [You](terminology.md#user) are solely responsible for the [Content](terminology.md#content) of, and for any harm resulting from, any [Content](terminology.md#content) that [You](terminology.md#user) post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the [Service](terminology.md#service), regardless of the form of that [Content](terminology.md#content). [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) are not responsible for any public display or misuse of [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content).

### 2. We may remove Content
[We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) do not pre-screen [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content), but [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any of [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content) that, in [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) sole discretion, violates any [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) terms or policies.

### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
[You](terminology.md#user) retain ownership of and responsibility for [Content](terminology.md#content) [You](terminology.md#user) create or own ("[Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content)"). If [You're](terminology.md#user) posting anything [You](terminology.md#user) did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, [You](terminology.md#user) agree that [You](terminology.md#user) are responsible for any [Content](terminology.md#content) [You](terminology.md#user) post; that [You](terminology.md#user) will only submit [Content](terminology.md#content) that [You](terminology.md#user) have the right to post; and that [You](terminology.md#user) will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to [Content](terminology.md#content) [You](terminology.md#user) post.

Because [You](terminology.md#user) retain ownership of and responsibility for [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content), [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) need [You](terminology.md#user) to grant [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) — and other [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Users](terminology.md#user)— certain legal permissions, listed in Sections titled "[Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content)". These license grants apply to [Your](terminology.md#user) [Content](terminology.md#your-content).

## E. Organizations

**Short version** 

*[You](terminology.md#user) may create an [Organization](terminology.md#organization) [Account](terminology.md#account). [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) treat the [Content](terminology.md#content) of an [Organization](terminology.md#organization) as confidential, and [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) only access it for support reasons, with [Your](terminology.md#user) consent, or if required to for security reasons.*

[Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) will protect the [Content](terminology.md#content)s of [organizations](terminology.md#organization) from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) would use to protect [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

When access is required for security reasons. [You](terminology.md#user) may choose to enable additional access to [Your](terminology.md#user) [Organization](terminology.md#organization). For example:

If those [Services](terminology.md#service) or features require rights in addition to those [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) need to provide the [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Service](terminology.md#service), [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will provide an explanation of those rights.

* [You](terminology.md#user) may also grant a third-party application authorization to use, access, and disclose the [contents](terminology.md#content) of [Your](terminology.md#user) [Organization](terminology.md#organization).

By seeing the past revisions [You](terminology.md#user) can see [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) progression of thought over time. By allowing [You](terminology.md#user) to post suggestions, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) are enlisting [Your](terminology.md#user) help to make improvements to this [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) in conjunction with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) ever-changing world. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) will notify [Users](terminology.md#user) of any changes that affect [Your](terminology.md#user) rights and give [You](terminology.md#user) time to adjust to them. For non-material modifications, [Your](terminology.md#user) continued use of the [Website](terminology.md#website) constitutes an agreement to [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) revisions of this User Agreement.*

This [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) is open to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This means [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) give [You](terminology.md#user) permission to copy and re-use this [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) permission. No questions asked.  Note that CC0-1.0 does not grant any trademark permissions.

Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever [You](terminology.md#user) prefer. We've made an issue template to request information that will help [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) better understand [Your](terminology.md#user) feedback.

Before [You](terminology.md#user) decide to open an issue, browse [open issues](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/issues) to see current requests. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) also generally want to hear about: 

* International issues with [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement)
* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies

Open an issue to tell [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) about any of the above. [You](terminology.md#user) may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** 
Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed, or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps [Us](terminology.md#era-of-health) know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If [You](terminology.md#user) decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will merge it directly. It's not because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) don't like [Your](terminology.md#user) ideas, but because [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

At this moment [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) have an annual review and modification process of the repository and the feedback [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) received. If changes are not needed, great! We'll let [You](terminology.md#user) know that we're not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) may alter this [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) outside that schedule if necessary, such as when [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) have new product releases.

[You](terminology.md#user) can expect that someone from [Era of Health’s](terminology.md#eraofhealth) legal department will see [Your](terminology.md#user) feedback, but [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) might not respond immediately. If [You](terminology.md#user) need an immediate answer on a legal matter, contact support@eraofhealth.com.

If changes to this [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) are needed, [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) will freeze feedback for two weeks. We'll draft changes based on the pull requests and input we've gotten. Then we'll post the updated [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) as a pull request, and we'll get [Your](terminology.md#user) feedback on the pull request. The updated [Agreement](terminology.md#agreement) will be available here for 30 days before it goes into effect.

**NOTE:** 
Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If [You](terminology.md#user) need help, contact support@eraofhealth.com and they'll get [You](terminology.md#user) an answer.

Please avoid hypotheticals. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) can't give [You](terminology.md#user) legal advice, which means [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) often can't tell [You](terminology.md#user) if a hypothetical situation would or wouldn't be a violation of [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) also can't tell [You](terminology.md#user) what [You](terminology.md#user) should or shouldn't do. [We](terminology.md#eraofhealth) can tell [You](terminology.md#user) how [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) interpret [Our](terminology.md#era-of-health) policies.

Please don't give other [Users](terminology.md#user) legal advice in this repository, to avoid confusion.
