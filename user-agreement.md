## A. Definitions

**Short version**

*We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*
* The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “User Agreement”) and all other operating rules, policies (including the [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) Privacy Policy, available at eraofhealth.com and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the [Website](terminology.md#website). Most of our site policies are available at eraofhealth.com in the footer or on our publicly viewable github [account](terminology.md#account) https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/tree/master

* "[Bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth)" In computing, [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth) is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path. [Bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth) may be characterized as network [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth), data [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth), or digital [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth). This definition is in contrast to other fields that define [bandwidth](terminology.md#bandwidth) as an analog signal measured in hertz.

* "[Bots](terminology.md#bots)" also known as an internet bot, web robot, or WWW robot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Typically, [bots](terminology.md#bots) perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

* “[Content](terminology.md#content)” is [content](terminology.md#content) featured or displayed through the [Website](terminology.md#website), including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the [Website](terminology.md#website) or otherwise available through the [Service](terminology.md#service). "[Content](terminology.md#content)" also includes [Service](terminology.md#service). [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) is [Content](terminology.md#content), written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our [Users](terminology.md#user). "[Your Content](terminology.md#your-content)" is [Content](terminology.md#content) that [You](terminology.md#user), the [Users](terminology.md#user) create or own. See [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content).

* “[Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth),” “We,” and “Us” refer to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth), Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.

* "[Moral rights](terminoloyg.md#moral-rights)" are the rights of creators of copyrighted works. [Moral rights](terminology.md#moral-rights) are distinct from any economic rights tied to copyrights. Even if a creator has assigned their copyright rights to a third party, they maintain the [moral rights](terminology.md#moral-rights) to the work. They include the right of integrity and attribution unless waived. 

* "[Scraping](terminology.md#scraping)" also known as Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is the act of copying data from websites. While [scraping](terminology.md#scraping) can be done manually, the term typically refers to automated processes using a [bot or web crawler](terminology.md#bots).

* The “[Service](terminology.md#service)” refers to the applications, software, products, and [services](terminology.md#service) provided by [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth).

* “[User](terminology.md#user),” Sometimes displayed as "You" or Your". In [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) Legal documents, or while using [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) or working with our API, this refers to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using [Era of Healths](terminology.md#era-of-health)services; that accesses or uses any part of the account, or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A [User](terminology.md#user) must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for government accounts.

* “[Your Content](terminology.md#your-content)” is [Content](terminology.md#content), written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our [Users](terminology.md#user). "Your Content" is [Content](terminoloy.md#content) that [You](terminology.md#user) create or own.

* The “[Website](terminology.md#website)” refers to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth)’s website located at eraofhealth.com, and all [content](terminology.md#content), [services](terminology.md#service), and products provided by [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) at or through the [Website](terminology.md#website). It also refers to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth)-owned subdomains. This Agreement also governs [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) product websites with [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) copyright in the footer. 

  Occasionally, websites owned by [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) may provide different or additional user agreements. If those conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

 
## B. Account Terms  

**Short version** 
*A human must create your [account](terminology.md#account); you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address, and you may not have more than one [User](terminology.md#user) [account](terminology.md#account). You can have multiple [organization](terminology.md#organization)  [account](terminology.md#account)s.  You alone are responsible for your [account](terminology.md#account) and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your [User](terminology.md#user) [account](terminology.md#account). You are responsible for keeping your [User](terminology.md#user) [account](terminology.md#account) secure.*

### 1. Required Iinformation
You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your phone number, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid [account](terminology.md#account), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### 2. Account requirements
We have a few simple rules for [account](terminology.md#account)s on [Era of Health’s](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Service](terminology.md#service).

* You must be a human to create an [account](terminology.md#account). [Accounts](terminology.md#account) registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. 

* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free [User](terminology.md#user) [account](terminology.md#account).

* You must be age 13 or older. We must comply with United States law and not target our [Service](terminology.md#service) to children under 13, and we do not permit any [Users](terminology.md#user) under 13 on our [Service](terminology.md#service). If we learn of any [User](terminology.md#user) under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s [account](terminology.md#account) immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid [organization](terminology.md#organization)  [account](terminology.md#account) may create separate logins for as many [Users](terminology.md#user) as its subscription allows.

* Overall, the number of [Users](terminology.md#user) must not exceed the number of [account](terminology.md#account)s you've ordered from us.

### 3. User account scurity
You are responsible for keeping your [account](terminology.md#account) secure while you use our [Service](terminology.md#service). We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your [account's](terminology.md#account) security, but the [content](terminology.md#content) of your [account](terminology.md#account) and its security are up to you.

You are responsible for all [content](terminology.md#content) posted and activity that occurs under your [account](terminology.md#account) even when [content](terminology.md#content) is posted by others who have [accounts](terminology.md#account) under your [account](terminology.md#account)).

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your [account](terminology.md#account) and password. [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.

You will promptly notify [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our [Service](terminology.md#service) through your [account](terminology.md#account), including any unauthorized use of your password or [account](terminology.md#account).

### 4. Additional terms
In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth). For example, you may be a member of an [organization](terminology.md#organization)  on [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth), or you may use [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government [User](terminology.md#user) or otherwise accessing or using any [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Service](terminology.md#service) in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) User Agreement applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

**Short version** 
*You own [content](terminology.md#content) you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the [content](terminology.md#content) you post. You still have control over your [content](terminology.md#content), and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove [content](terminology.md#content) or close [accounts](terminology.md#account) if we need to.*

### 1. Responsibility for Your Content
You may create or upload [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) while using the [Service](terminology.md#service). You are solely responsible for the [content](terminology.md#content) of, and for any harm resulting from, any [Content](terminology.md#content) that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the [Service](terminology.md#service), regardless of the form of that [content](terminology.md#content). We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content).

### 2. We may remove Content
We do not pre-screen [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content), but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) that, in our sole discretion, violates any [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) terms or policies.

### 3. Ownership of Content, right to post, and license grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for [content](terminology.md#content) you create or own ("[Your Content](terminology.md#your-content)").

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content), we need you to grant us — and other [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Users](terminology.md#user)— certain legal permissions, listed in Sections titled "[Your Content](terminology.md#your-content)." These license grants apply to [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content). If you upload [content](terminology.md#content) that already comes with a license granting [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) the permissions we need to run our [Service](terminology.md#service), no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Section titled "[Your Content](terminology.md#your-content)." The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) from our servers.

### 4. License grant to us
We need the legal right to do things like host [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content), publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content), and make incidental copies as necessary to render the [Website](terminology.md#website) and provide the [Service](terminology.md#service). This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other [users](terminology.md#user); parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other [user's](terminology.md#user); and perform it, in case [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) is something like music or video.

This license does not grant [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) the right to sell [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the [Service](terminology.md#service).

### 5. Moral Rights
You retain all [moral rights](terminology.md#moral-rights) to [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the [Service](terminology.md#service), including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) the rights we need to use [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) as necessary to render the [Website](terminology.md#website) and provide the [Service](terminology.md#service).

## E. Organizations
**Short version** 
You may create an [organization](terminology.md#organization)  [account](terminology.md#account).

[Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) will protect the [content](terminology.md#content)s of [organizations](terminology.md#organization)  from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### 3. Access.
[Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) employees may only access the [content](terminology.md#content) of your [organization](terminology.md#organization) in the following situations:

* With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) accesses an [organization](terminology.md#organization) for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.

When access is required for security reasons. You may choose to enable additional access to your organization. For example:

* You may enable various [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [services](terminology.md#service) or features that require additional rights to [Your Content](terminology.md#your-content) in [organizations](terminology.md#organization) . These rights may vary depending on the [service](terminology.md#service)or feature, but [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) will continue to treat your [organization](terminology.md#organization) [Content](terminology.md#content) as confidential. If those [services](terminology.md#service) or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) [Service](terminology.md#service), we will provide an explanation of those rights.

* You may also grant a third-party application authorization to use, access, and disclose the [contents](terminology.md#content) of your organization.

## O. Changes to this User Agreement
**Short version** 

*We've opened this Agreement up for you to amend and contribute to. We want you to see its historic revision and contribute to it future revision via a repository. We take our relationship with you very serious and want to display nurture trust through transparency. By seeing the past revision you can see our progression of thought over time. By allowing you to post suggestions we are enlisting your help to make improvements to this Agreement in conjunction with our ever-changing world. We will notify [users](terminology.md#user) of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the [Website](terminology.md#website) constitutes an agreement to our revisions of this User Agreement.*

This Agreement is open to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This means we give you permission to copy and re-use this Agreement with our permission. No questions asked.  Note that CC0-1.0 does not grant any trademark permissions.

Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever you prefer. We've made an issue template to request information that will help us better understand your feedback.

Before you decide to open an issue, browse [open issues] to see current requests. We also generally want to hear about: 

* International issues with our Agreement
* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of our policies

Open an issue to tell us about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** 
Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps us know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that we will merge it directly. It's not because we don't like your ideas, but because we will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

At this moment we have an annual review and modification process of the repository and the feedback we received. If changes are not needed, great! We'll let you know that we're not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, [Era of Health](terminology.md#eraofhealth) may alter this Agreement outside that schedule if necessary, such as when we have new product releases.

You can expect that someone from [Era of Healths](terminology.md#eraofhealth) legal department will see your feedback, but we might not respond immediately. If you need an immediate answer on a legal matter, contact help@eraofhealth.com

If changes to this Agreement are needed, we will freeze feedback for two weeks. We'll draft changes based on the pull requests and input we've gotten. Then we'll post the updated Agreement as a pull request, and we'll get your feedback on the pull request. The updated Agreement will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

**NOTE:** 
Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. We may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If you need help, contact help@eraofhealth.com and they'll get you an answer.

Please avoid hypotheticals. We can't give you legal advice, which means we often can't tell you if a hypothetical situation would or wouldn't be a violation of our policies. We also can't tell you what you should or shouldn't do. We can tell you how we interpret our policies.

Please don't give other [users](terminology.md#user) legal advice in this repository, to avoid confusion.
