### Changes to this document

We've opened this document up for you to amend and contribute to. We want you to see its historic revision and contribute to it future revision via a repository. We take our relationship with you very serious and want to display nurture trust through transparency. By seeing the past revision you can see our progression of thought over time. By allowing you to post suggestions we are enlisting your help to make improvements to this document in conjunction with our ever-changing world. 

This document is open to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). This means we give you permission to copy and re-use this document with our permission. No questions asked.  Note that CC0-1.0 does not grant any trademark permissions.

Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever you prefer. We've made an issue template to request information that will help us better understand your feedback.

Before you decide to open an issue, browse [open issues] to see current requests. We also generally want to hear about: 

* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of our policies

Open an issue to tell us about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps us know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that we will merge it directly. It's not because we don't like your ideas, but because we will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

At this moment we have an annual review and modification process of the repository and the feedback we received. If changes are not needed, great! We'll let you know that we're not putting out an update, and we'll close any issues or PRs that are still hanging around. This allows plenty of time for discussion. Of course, Era of Health may alter this document outside that schedule if necessary, such as when we have new product releases.

You can expect that someone from Era of Health will see your feedback, but we might not respond immediately. If you need an immediate help on a term, contact help@eraofhealth.com

If changes to the document are needed, we will freeze feedback for two weeks. We'll draft changes based on the pull requests and input we've gotten. Then we'll post the updated document as a pull request, and we'll get your feedback on the pull request. The updated document will be available here for thirty days before it goes into effect.

Please don't post complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. We may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If you need help, contact help@eraofhealth.com and they'll get you an answer.

### Patient Check-in
Patient check-in is the process where patients check-in to begin their registration with the healthcare facility topically using a clipboard, electronic tablet, touch screen, kiosk, or some other method, sometimes self-service. Patient check-in started as far back as the Roman times when patients would wait for special services in purpose-built hospitals. Romans were the first to have hospitals with doctors assigned to consult and observe patients. Prior to the Romans, many cultures such as the Greeks relied on temples and the Gods to cure through supernatural forces. As patient services were made more available, so was the need to have some method of tracking patients as they arrived.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_check-in 

### Patient Diary
An electronic patient diary registers the data in a storage device and allows for automatically monitoring the time the entry was made.
Frequent recording of symptoms using a diary helps to reduce recall bias. Electronic diaries ensure entries are made as scheduled, and not, for example, in a batch immediately before the clinic visit.
Patient diaries are also a way to find out if a patient takes the medication according to the treatment schedule, which is an important problem during clinical trials and the treatment of degenerative diseases with relatively few symptoms.

### Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO)
A patient-reported outcome (PRO) is a health outcome directly reported by the patient who experienced it. It stands in contrast to an outcome reported by someone else, such as a physician-reported outcome, a nurse-reported outcome, and so on. PRO methods, such as questionnaires, are used in clinical trials or other clinical settings, to help better understand a treatment's efficacy. The use of digitized PROs, or electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs), is on the rise in today's health research industry.

### Value-Based Care
Accountable care organizations (ACOs) were originally designed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide high-quality medical care to Medicare patients. In an ACO, doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers work as a networked team to deliver the best possible coordinated care at the lowest possible cost. Each member of the team shares both risk and reward, with incentives to improve access to care, quality of care, and patient health outcomes while reducing costs. This approach differs from fee-for-service health care, in which individual providers are incentivized to order more tests and procedures and manage more patients in order to get paid more, regardless of patient outcomes.
Like PCMHs, ACOs are patient-centered organizations in which the patient and providers are true partners in care decisions. Also like PCMHs, ACOs stress coordination and data sharing among team members to help achieve these goals among their entire patient population. Clinical and claims data are also shared with payers to demonstrate improvements in outcomes such as hospital readmissions, adverse events, patient engagement, and population health.
