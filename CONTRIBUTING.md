# Contributing

Hi there! [We're](terminology.md#era-of-health) thrilled that you'd like to contribute to [Era of Health's](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents). Your help is essential. Our [README](README.md) describes [Era of Health's](terminology.md#era-of-health) [Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents), their purposes, caveats, and is necessary reading for contributors.

Contributions are dedicated to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](LICENSE.md).

Remember that information in this repository [is not legal advice and comes without warranty](README.md#disclaimer).

Please note that this is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct). By participating in this you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

As we mentioned in [README](README.md), [we're](terminology.md#era-of-health) mostly looking for contributions to a few of the [Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents), listed below. However, just because a document is on the list, it does not mean that the terms are flexible. The current [User Agreement](user-agreement.md) and [HIPAA Business Associate Agreement](hipaa-baa.md) can found on our [Website's](terminology.md#website) homepage footer, at https://eraofhealth.com, and all [Users](terminology.md#users) must agree to them before using our [Website](terminology.md#website). [We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) opened this repo to provide more transparency around the updates to those [agreements](terminology.md#agreement), to allow you all to help us improve them, and to do so the [Era of Health](terminology.md#era-of-health) way. Here are the policies [we're](terminology.md#era-of-health) currently hoping you'll contribute to:

* [Era of Health User Agreement](https://eraofhealth.com/user-agreement)
* [Era of Health Privacy Policy](https://eraofhealth.com/privacy-policy)
* [Era of Health HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA)](https://eraofhealth.com/HIPPA-BAA)

Like other repositories, the two main ways to contribute are through Issues and Pull Requests. Feel free to use either option, whichever you prefer. [We've](terminology.md#era-of-health) made an issue template to request information that will help us better understand your feedback.

## Help Wanted

Before you decide to open an issue, browse [open issues](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/issues) to see current requests. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) also generally want to hear about:

* International issues with our policies
* Typos
* Clearer wording
* Other sites that have adapted and reused some of our policies

[Open an issue](https://github.com/eraofhealth/conduct/issues/new) to tell [us](terminology.md#era-of-health) about any of the above. You may also open a pull request to propose specific changes, but it's always OK to start with an issue.

**NOTE:** Issues are best used as a task list, where each issue contains one and only one thing to be addressed, resolved, fixed or decided. So please include only one work item per issue. This helps us know when issues are completed and can be closed. In turn, this helps everyone watching the issues know when the item they're interested in has been resolved.

If you decide to open a pull request to the master branch, please be aware that it is unlikely that we will merge it directly. It's not because [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) don't like your ideas, but because [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will be opening new draft branches with each round of changes.

In general, before [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) make official changes to our [Conduct Documents](terminology.md#conduct-documents), [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will open a pull request in this repository, showing all the draft changes on a working branch. In that pull request, [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will do our best to cross link back to open issues or pull requests that [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) think are resolved or addressed by the draft changes. When those draft changes are ready to be published, [we](terminology.md#era-of-health) will make them on the official live version on our [website's](terminology.md#website) homepage footer, at https://eraofhealth.com. After that, [we'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) merge the working branch in this repository.

**NOTE:** Please don't post legal complaints or ask for technical support in this repository. [We](terminology.md#era-of-health) may not respond to issues or comments promptly. If you need help, contact Support(support@eraofhelp.com) and [we'll](terminology.md#era-of-health) get you an answer.
